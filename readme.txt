== Description ==


Need to add an online summary to BuddyPress? We developed a plugin that is small and compact just for you.

There is no backend settings to configure, it's all frontend, just that simple.  This plugin displays a 
Wordpress user's biography on a BuddyPress tab when viewing the user's BuddyPress profile.



== Installation ==
1a. Upload the bp_summary_page folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
or
1b.Download through the plugins manager in the WordPress backend admin area. 

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Enter a text blob into a user's wordpress profile and check to see that this displays in the user's 
   BuddyPress Summary Tab, and your Done.
